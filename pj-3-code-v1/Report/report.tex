    \section{Method and Improvement} 
    The method I use for this game is monte carlo tree search with root parallelization. Total number of simulation is set to 
    1350 and every thinking time is limited to 3 seconds in order not to exceed the total thinking time 40 seconds in a game.
    This agent can reach 100 winrate against to weak judge. While againsting with medium and strong one it not performed well. 
    I have tried to do RAVE, but the result is worse than the default one. I have not figured it out why.
    \section{Experiment}
    Winrate is calculating by playing 50 games with judges. \\
    Every agent runs 1350 simulation and thinking 3 seconds per action.\\
    \begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
    \hline
    method & weak & medium\\
    \hline
    Default & 94\% & 20\% \\
    2 parallel & 100\% & 35\% \\ 
    4 parallel & 100\% & 48\% \\
